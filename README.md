# RNAsselem
a Python package for descriptive analysis of RNA secondary structure elements in viral genomes

# Installation

# Features

* convertion from dot-bracket or CT format to WUSS format
* calculation of statistics on the pairing and unpairing of nucleotides
* calculation of statistics on genome coverage by different types of structural elements; 
* generation a list of structural elements of a particular type with information on position and size, including hairpin loops, internal loops, bulges, and multifurcation loops; 
* calculation of statistics on structural elements of a given type, providing a frequency of occurrence in the genome, as well as compiting the mean, median, standard deviations of the element size, and the total length of the elements in the genome.
